\lettercontent{Dear Recruiter,}

\lettercontent{Dear Hiring Manager, I am writing to express my strong interest in the Applied Scientist Intern position at Amazon Core Search, which I found through LinkedIn. With a solid background in Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative models, I am confident that my skills and experience make me an ideal candidate for this role.}

\lettercontent{As a seasoned data scientist with expertise in LLMs and generative models, I possess the technical acumen to excel in this position. My hands-on experience with tokenizer customization/design and model architectures will enable me to tackle the challenges of domain-specific generative models. Additionally, my familiarity with modern training paradigms such as SFT, RLHF, and LoRA aligns perfectly with Amazon's cutting-edge approach to AI research. I am particularly drawn to this role because of the opportunity to work on innovative projects that push the boundaries of language understanding and generation. My experience in developing a Random Forest classifier-based customer-level churn classification and prediction model at XPO demonstrates my ability to drive business impact through data-driven solutions. Furthermore, my implementation of an LLM-powered pipeline for automated invoice data extraction and classification showcases my expertise in leveraging LLMs for real-world applications. I am excited about the prospect of contributing my skills and experience to Amazon Core Search and being part of a team that is shaping the future of AI research.}

\lettercontent{Thank you for considering my application. I would be thrilled to discuss this opportunity further and explore how my expertise can contribute to the success of Amazon Core Search. Please feel free to contact me at your convenience. I look forward to hearing from you soon.}
